# Static-Node-And-Express-Site
 Portfolio website Using Node, Express and PUg
 
 
## Project Details
- As the site opens, the viewer is greeted with a brief introduction of myself and a gallery of my very recent projects
- The sidebar on the left stays in view while the user browses through the site. In this section, you can get acces to the about page by clicking on learn more
- Each project within the gallery is clickable and the the user is directed to a page displaying details about that specific project. Few sample photos from the project are shown and a live demo along with it's GitHub repo are also provided
- When the user finds themself traversing to an unknown page, an error page is displayed, indicating that this route does not exist on this site

## Added Styles
- The image in the sidebar rotates on hover
- The h5 in the project has a changed font and is aligned centre so it looks aesthetically balanced
- The project gallery is displayed in grayscale as the site loads but as the user hovers over it the original colour image is displayed
